WARNING
===============================================
173 entries in the sequences table had blank sequences :/ This is related to the
issue at https://github.com/merenlab/anvio/issues/565. If this is like mid-2020
and you still are getting this warning, please find an anvi'o developer and make
them feel embarrassed. If it is earlier than that, then take this as a simple
warning to remember that some gene calls in your downstream analyses may have no
amino acid sequences, and that's actuall OK. This is a very minor issue due to
on-the-fly addition of Ribosomal RNA gene calls to the contigs database, and
will unlikely affect anything major. This warning will go away when anvi'o can
seamlessly work with multiple gene callers (which we are looking forward to
implement in the future).

WARNING
===============================================
Well. Your COGs were successfully added to the database, but there were some
garbage anvi'o brushed off under the rug. There were 5 genes in your database
that hit 1 protein IDs in NCBIs COGs database, but since NCBI did not release
what COGs they correspond to in the database they made available (that helps us
to resolve protein IDs to COG ids), we could not annotate those genes with
functions. Anvi'o apologizes on behalf of all computer scientists for half-done
stuff we often force biologists to deal with. If you want to do some Googling,
these were the offending protein IDs: '428319768'.
